    API-key-style secrets, injected into the task container at launch (``--env-file``), so secrets
    stay out of the DB, artifacts, and image layers. The runner resolves it against its **own**
    host's secrets dir, so a remote runner uses its own secrets and the value stays host-agnostic;
    the file's content never crosses the wire.

    ``image_layer_file`` *references* the repo's Dockerfile fragment (ADR 0005's repo tier): a file
    name resolved relative to the task service's layers directory, not inline content. The task
    service reads it to serve over REST (``GET /repos/{id}/image-layer``) and the runner composes
    base → workflow → **repo** into the task image, so a repo can layer on its toolchain (e.g. `uv`,
    `make`). Empty/None = no repo layer.

    ``capabilities`` is a per-repo opt-in map for elevated container privileges the runner grants at
    spawn. ``docker_in_docker`` (a privileged nested Docker daemon) is the first — off by default,
    since it's a trust escalation (a privileged container ≈ host root).

    ``hook_file`` *references* an executable script the runner runs on the host after the per-task
    workspace is prepared but before ``docker run``: a **name relative to the runner's hooks dir**
    (``$PANOPTICON_CONFIG/hooks``), resolved against its **own** host like ``env_file`` is against
    the secrets dir, so a remote runner uses its own host's script. The hook runs with the checkout
    as its cwd and receives ``PANOPTICON_TASK_ID``, ``PANOPTICON_REPO_NAME``, and
    ``PANOPTICON_WORKSPACE`` as env vars; a nonzero exit aborts the spawn. Use it to modify the
