"""Local git: branch + worktree management — workflow-agnostic **core** ops (ADR 0004).

ADR 0004 puts *local* git (branch creation/naming, worktrees, teardown tiers) in the core,
agnostic of any workflow; only *remote* forge integration (PR/CI/merge) is workflow-specific.
This module is that core capability.

It shells out to `git` behind an **injectable command-runner** (the same pattern as the
docker/tmux runner) so it's unit-testable without a real repo, and LLM-free. It is the one
I/O-bearing module in `core`; the domain models and state machine stay pure.

The branch and worktree are named from the task **slug** (`panopticon/<slug>`,
`<root>/<repo>/<branch>`, refining cloude-cade's `cloude/<slug>`), so creation is **slug-gated**
— it cannot run before the agent has set the slug (ARCHITECTURE §8.3/§9).
