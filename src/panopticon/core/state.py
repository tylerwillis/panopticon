"""Workflow states, expressed as classes (declarative, à la an ORM model).

A state is a **class** used as a type-level identity (never instantiated). Subclass:

* :class:`State` — a non-terminal state. It carries an inherited transition to
  :class:`Dropped`, so every task is always droppable; concrete states add their own
  ``transitions`` (which accumulate with the inherited ``Dropped`` across the hierarchy).
* :class:`TerminalState` — a terminal state (no outgoing transitions).

``transitions`` entries are other state **classes** or their ``label`` **strings**; strings
are resolved to classes when the owning :class:`~panopticon.core.workflow.Workflow` is built
(forward references — e.g. cycles — must use strings, as with an ORM relationship).

Each state declares two orthogonal, immutable facts:

* ``turn_on_enter`` — who holds the turn *on entry* (distinct from ``Task.turn``, the live
  holder, which may differ later within the state);
* ``advanced_by`` — who moves the task *out* of the state (the user, or the agent once
  satisfied). These are independent: e.g. a plan state is left by the user (approval) yet
  the next state may begin on the agent's turn.
