"""Host shell-script runner: run a workflow's ``shell_script`` in a host tmux session, no container.

The companion to :class:`~panopticon.sessionservice.local_runner.LocalRunner` for workflows whose
:attr:`~panopticon.core.workflow.Workflow.runner_type` is ``"shell"``. Where the local runner
spawns a Docker container + a tmux pane execing into it, this runner just opens a **host tmux
session** whose single pane runs the workflow's script directly on the host — no image, no
per-task clone, no in-container agent. It's for short operator utilities that need a real shell and
TTY (e.g. ``claude setup-token``, whose interactive OAuth flow the operator completes by attaching
to the session).

It shares the local runner's tmux socket (``-L panopticon``) and its ``panopticon-<task_id>``
session naming, so the terminal supervisor's ``t`` (attach to a task's session) reaches a shell
task exactly as it does a container one. The command executor is **injectable** so the runner is
unit-testable without tmux. LLM-free — a shell task runs no agent.

        The session is named ``panopticon-<task_id>`` (matching the local runner) so the terminal

        the spawner prepares (empty by default, or a repo clone when the workflow opts in), or the
        workflow's own override. ``workdir`` falls back to the operator's home only when unset (direct
        use). The pane runs ``sh -c`` with ``PANOPTICON_SERVICE_URL`` and ``PANOPTICON_TASK_ID``
        exported — so the script can drive its own lifecycle over REST (e.g. advance to COMPLETE on
        success) — and the repo's ``env_file`` secrets sourced first when given. ``git_url``, when
        given, is exported as ``PANOPTICON_GIT_URL`` so a script can tell what forge the repo lives
        on (e.g. offer to record a GitHub token); ``repo_name`` is exported as ``PANOPTICON_REPO_NAME``
        so a script can name the repo in its summary. ``env_file`` is a
        **name relative to this runner's secrets dir** (ADR 0007), resolved host-locally (like
        ``LocalRunner``) so a remote runner uses its own host's secrets. The panopticon shell lib
        (``panopticon_advance``/``_drop``/…) is loaded into the shell so the script can drive its task
        over REST. It also holds a ``/live`` registration open in the background for the session's
        lifetime, so the dashboard shows the task **live** (not ``awaiting``) while the script runs. Reports ``STARTING`` (before the
        session) then ``AWAITING`` (once it's up) via ``progress`` — it composes to ``live`` once the
        background registration connects; there is no ``PREPARING``/``BUILDING`` (no clone, no image).
