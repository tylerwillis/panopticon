"""Agent-CLI harnesses (Milestone 3): the registry of pluggable in-container agent runtimes.

A task records which harness runs it (:attr:`~panopticon.core.models.Task.harness`, an opaque
string); the container's agent launcher and the session service look the mechanics up here.
The registry is a literal mapping — path discovery (the ``workflows`` treatment) waits until
operator-authored harnesses are a real use, not a hypothetical. claude is the only entry
today; the codex harness lands in the next slice."""
