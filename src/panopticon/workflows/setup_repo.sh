# Set up a repo's per-repo credentials for task containers: a Claude token, and — for a GitHub repo —
# a GH_TOKEN, written into the repo's env-file. Run by the session service in a host tmux session (no
# container); ShellRunner sources the repo's env-file first (so a configured credential shows up as
# an env var) and exports PANOPTICON_ENV_FILE (its path), PANOPTICON_GIT_URL (the repo's remote, used
# to detect a GitHub forge below), and PANOPTICON_REPO_NAME (the repo's label, for the summary).
#
# Each credential can be adopted from the operator's own environment, pasted, or (for Claude) minted
# with `claude setup-token`. Whatever route the operator takes, the script converges on a bulleted
# summary + a prompt to press Enter, which completes the task and returns them to the dashboard.

# The fallback text lives outside the expansion: an apostrophe inside a double-quoted
# ${var:-word} is read as a quote character by bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/sh) and unbalances
# the whole script.
