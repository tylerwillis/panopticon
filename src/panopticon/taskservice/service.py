"""The task service: deterministic orchestration over the store.

Owns the store (sole DB authority, ADR 0006), the workflow registry, the artifact
store, and ephemeral liveness registrations. All task-state mutations flow through here and
are enforced by the workflow before persistence ("transition enforcement at the boundary").

Uses a clock for timestamps and an id factory for ids; both are injectable so tests are
deterministic. No LLM (the determinism invariant).
