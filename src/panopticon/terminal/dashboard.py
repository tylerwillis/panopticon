"""The Textual dashboard (ADR 0002 presentation adapter): the operator's view of tasks.

A task table on the left, the highlighted task's state/turn/history on the right. It refreshes
from the task service **on change** — a background worker long-polls the change feed
(``list_tasks_versioned``), so the table redraws within a round-trip of a state change and stays
still when nothing changes (no fixed-interval redraw); `r` forces a refresh now. The redraw
preserves the highlighted row across the rebuild. Terminal (COMPLETE/DROPPED) tasks sink below
active ones and are rendered in faded/dim styling so they recede visually without a hard separator.

The task table, the repo table (`g`), and the `OptionList` pickers (`n`'s repo/workflow choice,
`a`'s artifact list) all accept vim-style `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as well as the arrow keys.

The footer legend shows only the essential, most-used keys — `t` hands off to the task's
container tmux, `n` creates a task (pick repo → workflow → describe the work), `x` **drops** it,
`/` searches, `d` **toggles the detail pane** (hidden by default so the table gets the full
width, press to reveal it), `q` quits, and `?` opens the **help screen** (a modal listing every key). The
rest still work but are hidden from the legend (both the footer bindings and `HelpScreen` derive
from the single ``HOTKEYS`` keymap): `r` refreshes from the task service over REST, `R` **respawns**
a down task (releases its claim so the host runner re-spawns it), `Ctrl+R` confirms and respawns
all tasks the service reports as down, `p` opens the task's `url` in the browser (cloude-cade's
`p` "open PR"), `g` opens the **repo config screen** (list / create / edit
repos — and it **opens automatically on start when no repos are configured**, the first-run
nudge to add one), `s` switches to the task-service session, and `a` opens a modal listing the task's
artifacts — Enter opens the selected
one with the host's default handler (`xdg-open`/`open`) by fetching it over REST to a temp file, `e`
opens the on-disk file in place when the dashboard shares the artifact store, `y` **copies the
task's slug** and `Y` its **id** to the clipboard (OSC 52 + the host's `pbcopy`/`xclip`/`wl-copy`,
so it works on Linux and macOS). Drop is the only state
*transition* the dashboard drives: every other transition starts a new agentic turn, so it's
triggered by an in-container agent skill (`advance` over REST/MCP; going back to coding is a free
`set_state` move), not the operator (ADR 0004).

`/` enters **search-as-you-type** (cloude-cade's `/`): a query box reveals at the bottom and the
table filters live to tasks whose slug/state/workflow/memo contains the query
(case-insensitive substring). `Enter` **locks** the filter — the box hides and normal navigation
keys return while the filter stays applied; `Esc` **clears** it (from typing or locked). The
filter is applied in ``action_refresh``, so a change-feed refresh preserves it across rebuilds.

`Enter` on a **governing task** (one with governed children) **collapses** its sub-tasks into a
single dim placeholder row (its slug cell renders ``...``); pressing `Enter` again **expands** them.
Arrow keys skip the ensemble row (it is not a real task). Expanding or collapsing does not affect the task service — it is pure
display state local to the dashboard.

The `container` column shows each task's container status: `live` (an active registration), `down`
(was up, container gone — respawn with `R`), `starting` (claimed, no registration yet — its
container is still coming up), `healing` (the runner is self-healing an orphan), or `–` (unclaimed
or just released by `R`, awaiting the runner's re-claim). Liveness is the registration, independent
of provisioning.

The dashboard does not attach to tmux itself: on `t` it calls ``on_switch`` (the terminal
supervisor, ADR 0009 §6, records the chosen session and detaches this client) and **keeps
running**, so when the supervisor re-attaches after the operator detaches the task, it is the
same live dashboard — cursor and all. Network calls are synchronous (small, local); moving them
to Textual workers is a refinement (docs/design/BACKLOG.md).
