"""The container entrypoint.

The entrypoint owns the deterministic in-container protocol around the agent (the agent is the
only thing that calls an LLM):

1. if the task has no **slug**, set one (the slug hook — slugs are decided in the container,
   unlike cloude-cade, per ARCHITECTURE.md §8.3);
2. connect to the task service and hold a **liveness connection** open — the open connection *is*
   the registration, so death (clean exit or crash) drops it and the service notices immediately;
3. do the work — the agent — alongside it.

Two shapes share that protocol:

* :func:`run_task_container` — one-shot, in-process; the agent is an injected callback. Used by
  the stub runner for the walking skeleton (no Docker). It registers/deregisters explicitly
  (there's no socket to drop in-process).
* :func:`serve` / :func:`main` — the long-lived form a real container runs as
  ``python -m panopticon.container``: set slug, then **hold the liveness connection until
  signalled**, reconnecting if it drops underneath. A clean stop closes the connection (a clean
  deregister); an unclean death drops it (the service reaps on disconnect). This is liveness only;
  the **agent** runs alongside it in the tmux pane via :mod:`panopticon.container.agent` (the
  launcher), so the roles stay separate and ``tmux attach`` reaches the live agent. (No LLM runs
  here or in tests.)
