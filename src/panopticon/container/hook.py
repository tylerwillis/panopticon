"""The turn-flip hook callback (`python -m panopticon.container.hook <user|agent> [prompt|stop]`).

claude's Stop / UserPromptSubmit hooks invoke this to flip the live turn (the Slice 4 contract);
so do the PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks matched to ``AskUserQuestion``, so the turn reads *user*
while the agent is asking the user something and *agent* once it's answered. It reads the task from
the container's env and POSTs `set_turn`. claude-specific wiring (M3); the deterministic turn
mechanism it calls lives in the task service. A turn-to-agent write also clears the deliberate
`blocked` marker; a turn-to-user write preserves it.

The first argument is the turn to set; the optional second selects an **event side-effect** — kept
distinct from the actor so the bare question hooks (`hook user` / `hook agent`) are a pure turn flip:

- ``prompt`` (UserPromptSubmit → ``agent``): print, into the agent's context (claude adds a
  UserPromptSubmit hook's stdout there), the **current-phase briefing** — which state the task is in
  and what that phase expects — so the agent knows where it is instead of charging ahead. While the
  task is still unslugged it additionally prints the provisioning nudge (ADR 0011 §3), reminding the
  agent to run the `provision` skill once it can name the task.
- ``stop`` (Stop → ``user``): record the session's cumulative token usage from the transcript the
  hook payload names (best-effort, silent), **and** gate the turn flip on background work. A
  background task (a Bash command launched with ``run_in_background``, the ``Monitor`` tool, or a
  background **agent**) keeps running after the agent's visible turn ends; its completion re-invokes
  the agent with a synthetic message — *not* a ``UserPromptSubmit`` — so a turn flipped to ``user``
  would never flip back even though the agent is about to be woken and keep working. So if the Stop
  payload reports any **live** background task (``background_tasks`` array, claude ≥ v2.1.145) we
  leave the turn on the agent; it flips to ``user`` on the eventual real stop with nothing in flight.
  If the payload lacks the field (older claude / empty stdin) we degrade to the plain flip.
